  summary: |
    I am eager to develop my professional career in an IT company where I can contribute both independently and as part of a team to achieve project goals. Currently, I am in my final year at the Polytechnic University of Timișoara, pursuing a degree in Automatics and Computers with a specialization in Informatics. Originally from the Republic of Moldova, I chose to study in Romania to deepen my knowledge and gain valuable experience in this dynamic field.

        At this job, I've worked as a full-stack web/mobile developer. I've created some apps like: app-builder.gaim-solutions.com,
        StoryTaim ( available on iOS and Android soon ), JobNinja ( a part of the code was written by me ) and a CV Matcher which
        found the perfect job for you based on your CV. The frameworks and language programming which I am using are: python, JavaScript,
        React, NextJS, React Native ( Tamagui framework ). I've worked with OpenAI's python package, which gave me access to ChatGPT and
        used it in our apps.

      company: Memorator.md SRL, Moldova
      details: |
        I was working on a mobile application for iOS and Android using React Native. This
        application will be available on Appstore and Google Play Market. It will be useful for students
        because in this app you can find any math, physics, or chemistry formula you need. I've used
        React Native for the front end and Node.js for the back end. For this application, I've created an
        admin panel too, in which you can modify the app content like adding formulas, categories, and
        so on.

    - role: Front-End Developer
      time: 2023 ( January ) - 2023 ( April )
      company: Liveclass.ro SRL, Romania
      details: |
        I worked as a front-end developer in a team of six people: three individuals focused on the front-end, and three on the back-end. My primary goal and task were centered around creating the
        website liveclass.ro. I held the responsibility of translating the design into code and ensuring its
        responsiveness across various devices. Throughout this process, my work was under the
        supervision of a senior developer with whom I collaborated closely, allowing me to acquire
        valuable insights into design principles and optimization techniques. During this experience, I
        utilized TypeScript and explored new tools like MUI, Axios, and Storybook

      company: Matematica.md SRL, Moldova

        The website made is matematica.md, this is a website builder in which you can also find an
        admin panel. In the admin panel, the owner of this site can modify the content website, colors,
        pictures, etc. For this project, I used React JS on the front and the back Node JS + Express +
        Sequelize. I worked with MySQL database and put into practice my knowledge. In this project,
        I've worked alone.
