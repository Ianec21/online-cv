      I want to develop my professional career in an IT company where I can work both in a team and
      independently to complete tasks assigned by the leadership. Currently, I am a second-year
      student at the Polytechnic University of Timișoara, pursuing a degree in Automatics and
      Computers with a specialization in Informatics. Although I am originally from the Republic of

        details: |
          I was working on a mobile application for iOS and Android using React Native. This
          application will be available on Appstore and Google Play Market. It will be useful for students
          because in this app you can find any math, physics, or chemistry formula you need. I've used
          React Native for the front end and Node.js for the back end. For this application, I've created an
          admin panel too, in which you can modify the app content like adding formulas, categories, and
          so on.

        details: |
          I worked as a front-end developer in a team of six people: three individuals focused on the frontend, and three on the back-end. My primary goal and task were centered around creating the
          website liveclass.ro. I held the responsibility of translating the design into code and ensuring its
          responsiveness across various devices. Throughout this process, my work was under the
          supervision of a senior developer with whom I collaborated closely, allowing me to acquire
          valuable insights into design principles and optimization techniques. During this experience, I
          utilized TypeScript and explored new tools like MUI, Axios, and Storybook
