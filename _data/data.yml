        I was working on a mobile application for iOS and Android using React Native. This
        application will be available on Appstore and Google Play Market. It will be useful for students
        because in this app you can find any math, physics, or chemistry formula you need. I've used
        React Native for the front end and Node.js for the back end. For this application, I've created an
        admin panel too, in which you can modify the app content like adding formulas, categories, and
        so on.

        I worked as a front-end developer in a team of six people: three individuals focused on the front-end, and three on the back-end. My primary goal and task were centered around creating the
        website liveclass.ro. I held the responsibility of translating the design into code and ensuring its
        responsiveness across various devices. Throughout this process, my work was under the
        supervision of a senior developer with whom I collaborated closely, allowing me to acquire
        valuable insights into design principles and optimization techniques. During this experience, I
        utilized TypeScript and explored new tools like MUI, Axios, and Storybook
